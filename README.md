# Wired  VS Wireless-Networks

## Wired Networks
### Definition:
A wired network uses physical cables (like Ethernet) to connect devices such as computers, printers, and routers.

#### Common Cables Used:
Ethernet (Cat5, Cat6)

Coaxial

Fiber Optic

#### Key Features:
Stable and consistent connection

High data transfer speed (1 Gbps to 10+ Gbps)

Low latency and interference

Usually more secure than wireless

Less mobility (devices must stay near the cable)

#### Advantages:
Faster and more reliable

Better for high-performance applications (e.g., gaming, video editing)

Less prone to interference from other devices

More difficult to hack into (requires physical access)

#### Disadvantages:
Limited mobility

Installation can be complex (cables everywhere)

Higher setup costs (especially for large buildings)

## Wireless Networks
### Definition:
A wireless network uses radio waves (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.) to connect devices without physical cables.

#### Common Technologies:
Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 standards)

Bluetooth

Cellular (4G/5G)

Infrared or Satellite (less common)

#### Key Features:
Offers mobility – users can move freely

Easier and cheaper to set up

Signal strength depends on distance and obstacles

More vulnerable to interference and hacking

#### Advantages:
Highly mobile and flexible

Easy installation and expansion

Ideal for portable devices (laptops, phones, tablets)

No physical clutter

#### Disadvantages:
Slower and less stable than wired (affected by distance and interference)

More vulnerable to security breaches (needs strong encryption like WPA3)

Limited range (typically 30-100 feet indoors)

## Use Cases:
#### Wired Network Best For:
Office desktops

Data centers

Online gaming setups

Video streaming/editing systems

Environments needing secure, high-speed, low-latency connections

#### Wireless Network Best For:
Homes and cafes

Smartphones and tablets

Remote work and flexible office layouts

Temporary setups (events, exhibitions)

### Hybrid Networks:
Many setups use both wired and wireless networks:

Wired for core infrastructure (servers, desktops)

Wireless for mobility and convenience (laptops, phones)

### Quick Analogy:
Wired network = A railway system – fast, secure, and fixed routes.

Wireless network = A car system – more flexible, but slower and traffic-dependent.
